Gatlena,

 

A young couple from Ghana are getting married at our church on Saturday August 19 at 2 pm.  Can you and your family join us?

 

This couple met in Sunday school in Ghana at their Presbyterian church when they were 9 years old and he proposed to her here.

 

This should be a fun wedding.

 

Weâ€™d love to see you and your family.

 

Thanks,

Forrest Dill - Dad
