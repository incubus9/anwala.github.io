Andrew,

 

Thank you!   How did you and Garrett get connected?

 

What software did you use to create this report? 

 

I’d like to get you linked to my Dill Family data base and me to yours.

 

I’ll update my Ancestory.com with your lineage.  I have not yet figured out how to merge date with your Canadian data base.

 

Mary and I are thinking about a trip to Nova Scotia.  We’d like to meet you and your family.  Maybe  summer 2019???

 

Mary also wants to go to Ireland sometime soon.  If we do, I’d like to invest some time searching for our forefather and mother.  Is Donegal, Ireland correct?

 

We appreciate you keeping in touch.

 

Thanks,

Forrest Dill
