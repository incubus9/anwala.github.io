You were always so witty...  as usual your bday card and gift are late.  Just got it off today.   I have been thinking about you a lot,  missing you and remembering the fun times we had with you growing up.  You were so fun and funny and intelligent,  we're never knew what you would do or say next.   
Anyway,  saw this cartoon and it reminded me of you.    Love you Ryan,  mom
