Hi there,

Has this ever happened to you?

You spot an opportunity for your company to do something better. You flesh out the idea, develop the proposal, and present it to the decision-makers.

And nothing happens.

Why do managers and business leaders pass on great ideas? Sometimes it boils down to apathy, aversion to change, and unconscious biases. Hard data can get you past all that—and give you the concrete proof you need to get to yes.

We designed our newest Pro Intensive, Introduction to Data Analysis, to teach professionals from every industry to persuade through data. This is the only course of its kind that doesn’t just teach the technical side—but also how to communicate your findings.

In your capstone project, you’ll solve a real-life data analysis problem and present your results. Our team of professional advisors, mentors, and industry leaders will help you strengthen your data-driven persuasion skills—which you can then apply to your career.

Next time, deliver a presentation with facts that your boss can’t ignore. Reserve your seat in our next Introduction to Data Analysis course. It starts on April 10th.
