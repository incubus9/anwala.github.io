Jana, thanks for the dessert, Karen, for the marinated salad...everything sounds so yummy.  So sorry about Marcia.  We will certainly miss her!!  And Karen, we will be doing random drug testing for steroid use.  Don't want you to have an unfair advantage.  LOL

Hello All, the lawn is green, the flowers are in bloom, the tables are set, the horseshoes are freshly painted, the mallets are clean.. yep, we're all ready for next Saturday's family get together!  Even the weather is cooperating, maybe a little too much, we're suppose to be high 80's, so maybe we'll have to run through the sprinkles after the Croquet match.  (Wonder who will win this year????)

Dear All,

 

Weâ€™re looking forward to a wonderful family gathering again this year on Saturday August 5th with good food, fun games, and a campfire.

 

We have amazing prizes for the champions of the games.

 

Do you know who your father/grandfather/great-grandfather is in this photo?  It was taken on the Varney family farm in about 1900.

 

Thanks,

Forrest Dill
