Subject: FW: A minute with GOD

 

Hi dear friends, I got this from a friend from “down south” … I thought you would appreciate it so am forwarding. Have a wonderful day, and take a minute for God!

See you next Thursday,

Peggy

 

 

I spent a minute and hope you will  too. (I know many of you always do.)


My name is God.  You rarely have  time for Me.  I love you and will always bless you.
I am always with you.  I need you to spend 60 seconds of your time with Me today.
Don't pray, just praise.  Today, I want this message to go around the world before midnight.
Will you help?  Please do not  delete it, and I'll help you with something you are in need of; even if it’s just quiet time.
Just dare Me!  A blessing is coming  your way.  Please drop everything and pass it on. Praise for 60 seconds…

Why are prayers getting shorter, but  bars and clubs are enlarging and expanding?
Why is it so easy to worship a  celebrity, but very difficult to walk with Me?
Think about it, and now you can offer a prayer. (Or are you going to ignore doing so, because you don’t have time for Me?)
Consider forwarding this to your friends.  80% of you may not.
When one door closes, I open two more.  If I have opened doors for you, send this message along to others, bless them for Me.
Thanks!
