Ryan, Garrett, and Kaytlyn,

 

Please read this incredible story from a friend at church.  She was a child in Hawaii when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor.

 

Think of Grandpa and Grandma Dill  and Great Grandpa Simmons who were in the military in WWII.  Grandma was at Oregon State when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and feared that the Japanese would invade.

 

Love,

Dad

Good morning, Forrest.  Here is what I presented to the children at the International School in Raleigh.  It’s the result of memories of mine and my sisters (my brother was 6 weeks old when this happened), and lots of research.  I hope you find it interesting.   I couldn’t figure out how to attach the Power Point pictures.  They are really interesting.  Sorry. 

 

It’s a forwarded message because when I sent it the first time I had put your email in incorrectly.

 

Our best to Mary as she continues her recovery.

 

Blessings

Heather
