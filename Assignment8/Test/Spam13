The clearXchange service is becoming Zelleâ„  and is now available in the USAA mobile app. As part of this transition, your profile with clearXchange will be deactivated on July 7, 2017.

To continue to receive money without interruption, we recommend that you deactivate your clearXchange profile and activate your Zelle profile with USAA today. Here's what you need to do:

Log in to www.clearXchange.com and you will be prompted to deactivate your clearXchange profile.
After deactivating, go to "Send money with Zelle" through USAA's mobile app and link your mobile number or email address to your bank account. This will activate your Zelle profile. Please make sure you have the latest version of the USAA mobile app.
By activating your Zelle profile with USAA, you'll have the ability to send and receive money, typically within minutes, between almost any bank account in the U.S.

After July 7, 2017, if you have not activated your Zelle profile, any payments you currently receive through clearXchange will no longer be automatically deposited into your USAA account. You will receive payment notifications prompting you to enroll with Zelle.

If you have questions about how to deactivate your clearXchange profile, please contact clearXchange customer service at 1-866-839-3488, Monday-Friday 8am - 12am EST. If you have questions about how to activate your Zelle profile, please reference the instructions at USAA's Send Money with Zelle website.

Thank you,
