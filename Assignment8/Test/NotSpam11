​Thank you, thank you, thank you!  What a wonderful time we had last Saturday.  You guys are the best!  I'll work on adding Marcia and show you our "best" photo soon.  Oh, Karen we have Teddy's water bowl and Cynthia, the lid and carrying case to your casserole dish.  Do you need it now?  Jewel and I could do a run this week...
Again, thanks and love to you all.  ​ Mary ​  
PS, looks like we were all pretty tired from having so much fun.
