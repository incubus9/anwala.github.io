Daniel Scott of Park School, a junior guard, has received an offer from Kent State of the Mid-American Conference, according to verbalcommits.com and various Tweets on social media.
Scott, a fourth-team All-Western New York pick last year, can shoot the three and is a leaper who can throw down dunks in transition.
Kent is the third offer he's received, according to the website. Verbal commits also lists Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference schools Canisius and Niagara as having offered the 6-foot-1 guard.
