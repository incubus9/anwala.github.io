Phoenix senior Samantha Doupe made history Saturday, becoming the program's career scoring leader with a 10-point effort against Bishop Ludden.
Doupe reached the top of the program's scoring charts in the third quarter by connecting on a free throw, giving her 1,417 points for her career. Phoenix head coach Ben Kochan said after the game that the achievement was a result of Doupe's relentless effort and focus on improving.
"It's a really nice honor for a tremendous player," Phoenix head coach Ben Kochan said. "She serves as an example to the community of how hard work can lead to success."
Kochan was complimentary of Doupe's speed and shooting ability. But in his mind, her intensity and drive set her apart as a player. It is that drive that saw Doupe chase down the program record after reaching 1,000 points more than a year ago in January 2017.
"She never needs to be pushed, she wants to win every drill and every game," Kochan said. "You're never going to see anyone play as hard as she does every possession. There's no quit in this kid."
The Firebirds did not get the result they were shooting for Saturday, falling to Bishop Ludden 67-53, but Kochan said that Doupe's influence will continue after her senior season ends.
"We get a great legion of fans, a lot of young girls traveling to see us play. They all wanted to take photos tonight," Kochan said. "It's easy to recruit girls when someone like Sam is in the program. That's something that I can't just do as a coach."
