TALLAHASSEE — The Florida State men’s basketball team, reeling from a two-game losing skid and trying to secure an NCAA Tournament bid, may be in for a challenge hosting No. 11 Clemson in the Donald L. Tucker Center on Wednesday at 7 p.m.
After loses to No. 1 Virginia and Notre Dame last week and dropping to 10th in the Atlantic Coast Conference standings, the Seminoles (17-8, 6-7) hope a win against the Tigers can boost their résumé to play in the tournament for the second straight season.
“When you look around the country every team will have some type of period in the year where they are not going to be playing well but could play better,” coach Leonard Hamilton said.
“I think we have had ours. Hopefully we can snap out of it and be like some of those other teams as well … We just have to make sure that we win our share to put us closer to the NCAA tournament.
The Seminoles have five regular season games remaining before the ACC Tournament is held in Brooklyn March 6-10. Some college basketball pundits have FSU as a No. 8 or 9 seed in the NCAA Tournament, but the Seminoles know their performance down the stretch will be vital for their postseason hopes.
“I think the last week and a half, we got ahead of ourselves,” junior forward Terance Mann said. “We started to think about that and we started to play with fear that we’re not going to make the tournament, and not playing to win. Two games in a row we lost.
“Every game from now on matters, and I think it’s going to bring the best out of our team. We know the season is on the line, and we just have to take it one game at a time, and be ready for every game.”
Clemson (20-4, 9-3) has the second-best record in the ACC, has won five of its last seven games, and already has 20 wins for the first time since 2013-14. The Tigers are ranked third in the ACC in scoring defense, limiting teams to 65.1 points per game.
Wednesday’s matchup will be the first meeting between FSU and Clemson this season, but both teams will play each other again 14 days later when the Seminoles visit the Tigers on Feb. 28.
“What we have to do is make sure we go out and be prepared as possible, physically and emotionally … I like our mindset,” Hamilton said. “For the most part whenever we hit a little skid, we always bounce back and I think that’s what we’re going to do come Wednesday night.”
Mann looking to rebound
Mann, who leads the Seminoles averaging 14.5 points per game, has seen his season average take a dip after his last two games.
Mann scored only three points in the loss to Virginia last Wednesday, and scored five points in a double-digit loss at Notre Dame on Saturday.
“I think it’s more of me just not being aggressive for some reason,” Mann said. “I think I only took a total of 10 or 11 shots in two games, so I think I just haven’t been that aggressive so I have to pick it up.
“I got to do well because when I do well, we all do well. So I have (to take) that ownership because I’m an older guy.”
