Graceland earns 11th conference victory of season with win over Grand View
LT Davis  scored 23 points in Graceland University's 80-75 victory over Grand View University.
"We started off the game incredibly well as we tried to control tempo and play in the half court," said  Craig Doty , head coach. "We shot 71% from the field in the first half and held our opponent to 35%. In the second half, I thought the Grand View coaching staff did a tremendous job of confusing our offense as they switched defenses in the middle of possessions. It really hurt us offensively. In addition, (Nathan) Washington caught fire and hit nine 3's. I am glad we found a way to finish the game and leave with a win."
Graceland shot 54.5 percent (30-55) from the floor, including 31.8 percent (7-22) from three-point range. Grand View shot 47.3 percent (26-55), including 47.8 percent (11-23) from beyond the arc. GU outrebounded GVU 34-26. The Yellowjackets handed out 15 assists.
LT Davis  and  Jeremy Deemer  highlighted the Yellowjacket offense with 23 and 18 points respectively.  Justin Harley  added double-figure scoring with 10 points. Deemer completed a double-double with 10 rebounds.  Dalton Payton  handed out five assists, while Harley recorded two blocks.
