Cruz, the ninth overall pick in the 2014 rookie draft, has seen his playing time dwindle this conference. He is averaging a career-low 2.0 points in just 13 minutes per game. He will be competing for minutes in a loaded TNT backcourt that already has Jayson Castro, RR Garcia, RR Pogoy, Ryan Reyes, and Alfrancis Tamsi.
Onwubere was picked eighth overall in last year's rookie draft by the Phoenix Fuel Masters before being traded in the offseason to the KaTropa. He has struggled to get minutes on a veteran TNT team, appearing in just five games and averaging only 1.6 points per outing. He could see more action with the Elasto Painters, where minutes are more evenly distributed among the players.
