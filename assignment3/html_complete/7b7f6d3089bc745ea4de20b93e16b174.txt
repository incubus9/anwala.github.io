30 X 3: For a third time this season, senior Mariah Ruff poured in 30 points in the Bonnies heartbreaking setback at VCU on Sunday in overtime. Ruff finished with 30 points and nine assists – the first time in over two decades that a Bonnies player has scored 30 points while handing out at least nine dimes. Ruff was just one off her career high in scoring of 31 points set vs. Saint Joseph's last month, and also posted 30 points at La Salle in January as well to become to only A-10 player with three 30-point performances this season.
 
MORE ON MARIAH: Ruff has been excellent all season while putting together one of the best campaigns of any player in the Atlantic 10 in 2017-18. Entering Wednesday, Ruff is the Atlantic 10's leading scorer in conference play, averaging 20.5 ppg in 12 A-10 games. Only Fordham's Bre Cavanaugh (20.0 ppg) is also averaging 20 points per game in A-10 competition this season. Ruff's 42 3-pointers against A-10 competition are also best in the league. For the entire year, the Oneonta, N.Y. native ranks seventh in scoring (16.5 ppg), second in assists (4.8 apg) and tied third in 3s (68). She enters Wednesday three 3-pointers away from fifth in program history (Katelyn Murray '09 - 197). Four more assists will also give her 400 for her career - a total only four other Bonnies have reached (Roni Hergenroeder '91, Casey Comoroski '94, Suzie Dailer '95 and Tricia Pawling '98).
 
MAKING THEM COUNT: Though limited to 16 games this season due to a leg injury suffered during December that cost her nine games, junior Mckenna Maycock continues to rank among the league's leaders in field goal percentages. Maycock leads the A-10 in percentage from beyond the arc – 47.3 percent (26-for-55) and ranks ninth in overall field goal percentage (48.0 percent). She delivered 15 points Sunday at VCU and has registered double-figure scoring in four straight games.
 
PILING BOARDS: Freshman Emily Calabrese made an impact on the boards Sunday at VCU, pulling down a career high 11 rebounds. Her previous best was 10, coming against Davidson last month. Calabrese has put in veteran minutes this season, starting every game while averaging nearly 29 minutes per contest in her debut campaign.
 
RAINING 3s: St. Bonaventure finished with 12 3-pointers in Sunday's game at VCU. The Bonnies have connected on 10 or more 3s in six times this year, including in two of the past three games (13 vs. George Mason on Jan. 31). That's the most for the Bonnies since hitting double-digit 3s seven times during the 2010-11 season, but it took 32 games to get there that season.
